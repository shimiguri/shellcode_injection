##  [ðŸ”¶] WELCOME TO PROCESS INJECTION

<img width="20%" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/hollowknight/images/5/5c/Char_shade.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190405191007"> 

**Here I will post about verious techniques of process injection!**
Techniques I have done so far:<br>
  ðŸ”¸Direct syscall injection<br>
  ðŸ”¸Win32 injection<br>
  ðŸ”¸Ntapi injection<br>
  
As I learn I will post my progress, expect the list to eventually increase... <br>
Most of my programs have to do with C, python or assembly so I highly recommend you learn those if you are confused. (Please also recognize that I am still very much an amature learning from those better then me)

**(ðŸ§¡) That being said, if you notice something poorly done (probably hard not to) please go ahead and contact me or issue a request. I have a lot to learn!**

P.S:<br>
  If anything you find on this git profile helps you or shows you something you werent aware of, you can let me know on discord!
