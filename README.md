<img width="20%" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/hollowknight/images/5/5c/Char_shade.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190405191007"> 

**Here I will post about verious techniques of process injection!**
Techniques I have done so far:<br>
  ðŸ”¸Direct syscall injection<br>
  ðŸ”¸Win32 injection<br>
  ðŸ”¸Ntapi injection<br>
  
As I learn I will post my progress, expect the list to eventually increase... ðŸ§¡<br>
Most of my programs have to do with C, python or assembly so I highly recommend you learn those if you are confused. (Please dont mind the poorly written code, I am still very much an amature learning from those better then me)
